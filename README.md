# Intro to SQL for Data Science

## Description

The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called *relational databases*. Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced *ess-que-ell*, or *sequel*). This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with databases today!
