title: Intro to SQL for Data Science
description: "The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights.
  Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction
  histories—lives in organized collections of tables called <em>relational databases</em>.
  Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract
  data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced <em>ess-que-ell</em>, or
  <em>sequel</em>). This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with
  databases today!"
